Menu -> Connect -> Auth

For now, authentication is limited to digest scheme, mostly because i'm not sure i need to integrate other schemes yet.

If i get enough requests for more auth schemes/integrations, i will be happy to work on it.

FYI - Auth is very basic, infact, getting a "Successful" alert is based on the fact that the API didn't throw an error.

In reality, auth is handled similar to the "addauth" command supplied by zkCli.

Scheme Specifics:

Digest Scheme - FYI: while passwords are masked in inspectorZK, they are stored in plain text in zookeeper. Another option to keeping passwords masked/hashed, is to first athenticate the use via Auth Menu option, then Add the ACL with "Auth" scheme. If this is for a user other than yourself, you will need access to that users credentials (id/pass).

Auth Scheme - This is used to add an authenticated user. This means you have authenticated via the Auth menu option prior to using this option.

IP Scheme - Provde a valid IP address.

SASL Scheme - Only way this is going to work is if your zookeeper instance has been configured with SASL.

World Scheme - Use this if you want a znode to be open to anyone with the selected permissions.
